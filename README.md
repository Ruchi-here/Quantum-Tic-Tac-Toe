# 💫 Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe

 Quantum Tic Tac Toe is a unique twist on the classic game of Tic Tac Toe, incorporating elements of quantum computing. 

 This game allows players to experience the fascinating principles of quantum superposition and entanglement while competing against each other or an AI opponent.
 
 

## ✏️ Features

Play against a friend or challenge the computer AI.

 📍**Quantum superposition:** The game leverages the power of quantum computing by introducing superposition. Each move is associated with a quantum qubit, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously.

 📍**Quantum entanglement:** The game introduces entanglement between qubits, creating a deeper strategic element. A move on one qubit can affect the state of other entangled qubits.

 📍**Visualize quantum states:** The game provides visual representations of quantum states using Dirac notation (ket notation), allowing players to understand and interpret the quantum effects.

 📍**Quantum randomization:** The computer AI utilizes quantum superposition to make random moves, creating a challenging and unpredictable opponent.
Win conditions: The game recognizes traditional win conditions (three in a row) as well as quantum win conditions, taking into account the entanglement of qubits.



## 💻 Technologies Used

 Python: The game is developed in Python programming language.

 Qiskit: Qiskit is a comprehensive open-source quantum computing framework that provides tools for creating, manipulating, and executing quantum circuits. It is used to implement the quantum mechanics of the game.

 Streamlit: Streamlit is a user-friendly Python library used to build interactive web applications. It is used to create the game's graphical user interface.

 NumPy: NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. It is used for array operations and calculations in the game
